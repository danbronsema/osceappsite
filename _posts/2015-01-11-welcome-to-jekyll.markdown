osceApp is a project started over the summer to build a little app to help with clinical examinations for students. The goal was to build the app I wish I had in the first 2 years of medical school. By making it open-source, it also hopefully represents a new way of developing medical resources for students and doctors. 

## Nerd stuff
The app is written in swift, the new development language by apple for iOS. Ideally both iphone and android would have open, interchangable development platforms, but this isn't the case. Platforms exist that allow for 'write once, deploy everywhere' mobile development, but they still fall short of native development. For now however, the next step is to develop an android version - so if you know of anyone who'd be interested please get in touch.  

## Helping out
Are you a gunner medical student? You can help by suggesting changes, reporting bugs, or even writing new content and examinations. If you want to make osceApp better, get in touch on twitter @danbronsema

Perhaps you are a coding superhero? You can submit pull requests for features and bugs via the github page. You might even be able to help port the iOS (swift) version of the app to Android! Get in touch on twitter [@danbronsema](https://twitter.com/danbronsema).

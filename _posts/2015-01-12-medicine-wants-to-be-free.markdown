Even with the open nature of the web, medical information and resources remain heavily restricted behind large publishing organisations. Similar to the way journal access has been kept behind paywalls, so too are medical resources. While wikipedia contains some great information, its purpose isn't targeted towards clinical aspects of diseases - such as examination findings, diagnosis and treatment. Resources such as BMJs Best Practice and UpToDate are fantastic and detailed, but are costly (prohibitively so for students), and don't support collaborative discussion and modification.

Given the expertise available by doctors, specialists and researchers around the world, it seems odd that there isn't a large-scale, collaborative and free resource for the medical profession. Bits and pieces of it exist out on the web. One site may have good section on pathophysiology, there's some blurry anatomy drawings on another site, a hospital site has guidelines on treatment, and you need to go scouring journal articles to find the latest research. Furthermore the best information and resources aren't free, making it hard for students and those in poorer countries to view content. 

 So what would the ideal resource look like? Probably just a more detailed wikipedia specifically targeted for medical professionals. Let's take an example with an article titled 'acute pancreatitis'. We can use wikipedia to add a basic overview of the condition. The pathophysiology would be written by a few the experts in the field who previously would publish into textbooks. The clinical information and examinations would be edited by the best physicians, those who would normally write articles for Best Practice and UpToDate. Resources like radiopedia would have great imagery to view as examples, and videos of surgeries would be provided from surgeons. There'd be a section for research, including the latest findings from Cochrane and well as recommendations for individual countries (similar to therapeutic guidelines in Australia). It would all be edited, discussed and collaborative. Would there be heated debates about best treatment? Yes - and there should be. This would help ensure the development of a 'best practice' resource anyone, anywhere could use. 

 Like most industries, medicine relies heavily on access to high-quality information to make the correct decisions. When this information is made difficult to access, both doctors and patients suffer. Medicine is by its nature, a collaborative field. Other disciplines have already begun to work towards open and free access to their information. It's long overdue that medicine did the same.

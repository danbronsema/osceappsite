You've done the biomed work, now its time to hit the wards and get your hands dirty. Here are some tips from Christie Bryant on how to get the most out of your clinical years.

## 1. Timing is everything
Try to be on time – I know we get this drilled in to us from first year, but it really does set students apart, and depending on your clinical site, it wont go unnoticed that you’re always that person that’s 5 minutes late. 

## 2. Sort out your pathology
If your course has them, get the pathology cases out of the way – and use them as a learning tool. I made the mistake of not really trying very hard to do them properly at the beginning of the year, but in the second half I made a point to either read a chapter in Underwood and/or Davidson’s, or at least go through the eLearning resources on the pathology site about the subject and it made a big difference.

## 3. Become a ward junkie
Spend time on the wards – you’ll get much more out of the year if you hang around on the wards after ward rounds, that’s when the interns do their jobs for the day, so this is the time for you to do cannulas and catheters and such.

## 4. Draw blood
Do some rounds with the phlebotomist – as an intern you’ll be taking plenty of blood, get the skills from people who do it all day long.

## 5. Keep a note on your notebook
Set aside time most evenings to go through your notebook - look up things you didn’t understand or read a chapter in Kumar/Davidson’s about a topic you learnt about that day.

## 6. Use the resources
Make sure to check out all the resources you can. For example the ePharm resource – that’s where Monash University takes the drug questions from for exams. Believe it or not, it actually has nice succinct information.

## 7. Braaaains
Pick the brains of registrars – they’re usually happy to answer your burning questions after ward rounds, and they’ll notice that you take an interest and give you top priority if interesting things are happening.
